# Aloft
Soar the skies in Aloft, the co-op sandbox survival game set in a world of floating islands. Build any island into a skyship, your home in the clouds. Find lost knowledge, cure the fungal corruption, and brave the hurricane to restore the ecosystem.

The egg will automatically generate a world using the settings you provide on the first startup, or if the world file specified doesn't exist. Once the world is generated it will automatically load the server with this world.

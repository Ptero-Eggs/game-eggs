- __Do not spoof any data__
  - Do not spoof any data sent by your server, this includes but is not limited to player/bot count
- __Bots have to be identifiable as such__ by having a clan tag (BOT or your clan tag) and a ping of -1 or 999
- __No offensive hostnames__
- __Do not impersonate__ other people/server hosters/clans
- __Do not suggest your server may be "official"__ or related to the IW4x maintainers in any way
- __Servers must be joinable__ with the latest stable IW4x release
  - If you run any customizations that prevent this your server __must__ be password protected
- __Do not require/suggest/recommend downloading a custom IW4x build__
- Be available for the maintainers to contact
  - This is not a hard requirement, but if we find an issue with your server we will try to contact you. If we can't get a hold of your server will be delisted without further notice.

#### __Violation of any rule may result in your server being delisted.__

● NWX/Config

The first time the dedicated server is launched on a particular weekday, it will copy the Offline

directory into the OfflineBackup directory.

## Enabling Cheats Mode on Clients
To enable debug/cheats, the client must be launched with the -EnableCheats commandline argument.

Players will need to authenticate with the admin password to use the cheats in-game
> [!IMPORTANT]

## Further Adjustements available

Status Endpoint (not built in egg )

To enable scraping server status from an http endpoint, add -statusPort=<port> to the commandline, where <port> is a port in the range 1024-65535.

Status can be scraped from  the /status endpoint periodically.

By default this will bind to localhost only. To bind to a specific IP, 

add -ini:Engine:[HTTPServer.Listeners]:+ListenerOverrides=(Port=<port>,BindAddress=<IP>) to the commandline as well, or use 0.0.0.0 to bind to all available interfaces.

If the server is still loading and not yet ready for players, it will return a 503 Server Unavailable http status and a JSON object

Once the server is ready for players, it will return a 200 OK status and a JSON object
